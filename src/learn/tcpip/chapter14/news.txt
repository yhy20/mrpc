The government, however, apparently overlooked a law that requires a CPA to
receive at least two years of practical training at a public accounting firm.
After realizing that, the FSS then suggested that firms listed on the Korea Stock
Exchange accommodate the newly minted CPAs, but accountants rejected the idea.
"The main purpose of selecting more CPAS is to ensure transparent accounting, "
said Yoon Jong-wook, head of the CPAs' own committee for improving training
conditions.
