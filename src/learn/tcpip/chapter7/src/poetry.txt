从明天起，做一个幸福的人
From tomorrow on, I will be a happy person;

喂马，劈柴，周游世界
Grooming, chopping, and traveling all over the world.

从明天起，关心粮食和蔬菜
From tomorrow on, I will care foodstuff and vegetables,

我有一所房子，面朝大海，春暖花开
I have a house,towards the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.

从明天起，和每一个亲人通信
From tomorrow on, I will write to each of my dear ones,

告诉他们我的幸福
Telling them of my happiness,

那幸福的闪电告诉我的
What the lightening of blessedness has told me,

我将告诉每一个人
I will spread it to each of them.

给每一条河每一座山取一个温暖的名字
And give a warm name for every river and every mountain.

陌生人，我也为你祝福
Strangers, I will also give you my well-wishing.

愿你有一个灿烂的前程
May you have a brilliant future!

愿你有情人终成眷属
May you lovers eventually become spouse!

愿你在尘世获得幸福
May you enjoy happiness in this earthly world!

我也愿面朝大海，春暖花开
I only wish to face the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.
